"We're taking acorns to the next level." - Peter Molyneux


Acorns contribute to the weight of two subtrees descending from the root of the tree. Move them around to balance the tree, lest it become 100% tipped in either direction.

Controls 
* UP - Move up tree
* LEFT - Move to left child
* RIGHT - Move to right child
* DOWN - Pick up/drop acorn
